Printers
There are different categories of printers including inkjet and laser printers.
 Inkjet printer – sprays small droplets of ink at high speed onto the surface of paper. This process produces high quality print approaching that produced by laser printers. Inkjet printers are reliable, quiet and inexpensive. Colour inkjet printers provide an inexpensive way to print full colour documents.

 Laser printer - uses a technology similar to that used in a photocopyingmachine. It uses a laser beam to produce images with excellent letter and graphics quality. They are quiet and fast but somewhat expensive compared to dot matrix and inkjet printers. Laser printers are widely used in applications requiring high-quality output.
Some printers, known as multifunction printers, have printing, scanning and photocopying features.
